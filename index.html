    /* 
    PROBLEM 1: Create a variable named str and set it equal to the string "hello"
               Next use bracket notation to try to mutate the string like this:
                str[0] = 'H';
               Now console log the variable str to see if it has changed
               Did the variable change? Why do you think that is?

    /* 
    PROBLEM 2: Create a variable named num and set it equal to the number 5
               Next use += to add three to the num variable like this:
                num += 3;
               Now console log the variable num to see if it has changed
               Did the variable change? Why?

    PROBLEM 3: Here is an object named obj containing a car called a "Honda" and owned by someone named "John".
               On the second line, use the right side of the equal sign to change the owner's name to "Tony"
               Now console log obj to see if it has changed.
               Did the object change? Why?

    PROBLEM 4: Here is an array named arr containing an array of numbers.

    /* 
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): We want to do a strict comparison between two variables. 
              The following code is supposed to console log the boolean false, since one is a string and the other is a number so their types are different.
              However, it is not working correctly.  Please fix the code so that it works, logging false instead of true.

    console.log(strictCompare);
