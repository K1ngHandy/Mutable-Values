    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run". 
    */

      /* 
    PROBLEM 1: Create a variable named str and set it equal to the string "hello"
               Next use bracket notation to try to mutate the string
               Now console log the variable str to see if it has changed
               
               let str = 'hello';
               str[0] = 'H'; // trying to modify the first character of the string
               console.log(str); // output: "hello"
               
               Did the variable change? Why do you think that is?
               It did not change. Strings in JavaScript are immutable, 
               meaning that their values cannot be changed once they have been created.
    */
      /* 
    PROBLEM 2: Create a variable named num and set it equal to the number 5
               Next use += to add three to the num variable
               Now console log the variable num to see if it has changed
               
               let num = 5;
               num += 3; // trying to modify the value of num
               console.log(num); // output: 8
               
               Did the variable change? Why?
               It has changed. However, it's important to note that we have not actually modified the original value of num. 
               Instead, we have created a new value of 8 and assigned it to num.

      /* 
    PROBLEM 3: Here is an object named obj containing a car called a "Honda" and owned by someone named "John".
               On the second line, use the right side of the equal sign to change the owner's name to "Tony"
               Now console log obj to see if it has changed
               
               let obj = { owner: "John", car: "Honda" };
               obj.owner = "Tony" // changing the owner's name
               console.log(obj); // output: { name: "Tony", car: "Honda" }

               Did the object change? Why?
               It has changed because objects are mutable.
    */
      /* 
    PROBLEM 4: Here is an array named arr containing an array of numbers.
               On the second line, inside the parenthesies, add the number 4.
               Now console log arr to see if it has changed
               
               let arr = [1, 2, 3];
               arr.push(4); // adding a new element to the array
               console.log(arr); // output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

               Did the array change? Why?
               It has changed because arrays are mutable.

      /* 
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): We want to do a strict comparison between two variables. 
              The following code is supposed to console log the boolean false, since one is a string and the other is a number so their types are different.
              However, it is not working correctly.  Please fix the code so that it works, logging false instead of true.
    */
      let myStr = "5";
      let myNum = 5;
      let strictCompare = myStr === myNum; // changed from == to === to do a strict comparison instead of a loose comparison
      console.log(strictCompare); // output: false
